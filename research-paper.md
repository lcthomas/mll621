<span style="font-weight: 400;">By class on Monday, February 27, you will have formed your primary question for your research paper. You will write an abstract of the paper, no longer than 300 words in which you detail the central argument you plan to make, methodology, and a sample of sources. Â This abstract should be formal, akin to something you could submit to an academic conference.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A formal essay between 8 to 9 pages must be turned in on or by Friday, March 10th. The essay should address a key topic in the digital humanities, demonstrate knowledge of the field, and offer an original argument. You may wish to critique a digital humanities project or text, or you may wish to produce a work which is itself a piece of critical theory for digital humanities. </span>
