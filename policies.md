## Required Texts

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our course readings are available online or through our shared Box folder. However, several of our readings come from the two </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates in the Digital Humanities</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">collections (2012 and 2016). While most contributions from these collections can be read online and are linked to below, students who would prefer to read print copies of these texts, or who are interested in pursuing the digital humanities further, may want to obtain the print editions of these collections:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates in the Digital Humanities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, edited by Matthew K. Gold (University of Minnesota Press, 2012), ISBN-10: 0816677956</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates in the Digital Humanities</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, edited by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren Klein (University of Minnesota Press, 2016), ISBN-10: 0816699542</span>
</li>

## Course Digital Infrastructure

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will make use of two different online systems in this course: a course site, and a class Box folder.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will use this site to manage course information and our schedule.Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will find an online version of our course calendar here (including the most up-to-date version of reading assignments and due dates), as well as information about all course assignments. We will also use a shared class Box (miami.box.com) folder to distribute class readings and to turn in assignments. You will also upload the text you give your presentation on to this shared folder. Every UM student, staff, and faculty member has access to Box, but you will need to create a Box account to access the shared folder. You will receive a link to this shared folder via email.</span>
